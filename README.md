***Ongoing project...***

 Terminology: 
 * Manager -> Person who generally created the team and has moderator permissions.
 * Member -> Person who is part of the team.
 * General -> Person viewing the team but is not a member or manager. 


## What 

Manage is a Web App created for teams to track the hours members are working/volunteering/practicing. Aside from offering hour tracking abilities, it offers comprehensive social media capabilities such as messaging other team members, seeing other member's information, having comprehensive ways of seeing how your hours have been changing, and most importantly having completely customizable information access and member information security. 

## How It Works

### Creating the team & choosing team settings.

A Manager creates a new Team where they choose what information any Member joining must submit. Upon choosing the information required by members, what information is accessible to others depending on their access level, and certain team settings, they will receive a team code. They can share that team code with members wanting to join the team. 

### Joining the team

Upon entering the team code given to the member by the manager, they will be presented with the fields the manager requires them to fill out. Upon filling them in, their profile will be submitted to the manager. Once the manager permits for the member to join, the member will be part of the team.

### View personal and others info.

Once you are on the team, you are subject to the rules and settings the manager chose when they created the account at first.
